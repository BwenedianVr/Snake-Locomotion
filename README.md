# Snake Locomotion by Bwenedian
This is extremely basic for now. Feel free to see the code if you want just no taking it. 
You probably wont though, since nobody really cares about someones snake locomotion project.
# Some ideas i have for the future of this:
• Multiplayer (Planning on asking a more experienced coder to help guide me on this, i dont know how to even start)
• Better graphics. These include snake eyes, and maybe i will use pngs for the segments once i learn how to rotate canvas images.
• Better gameplay
• Voice chat and normal chat (if possible)
